This repository contains all of the code for the Data Expo entry, "Let's talk 
about the weather" by Jill Lundell, Brennan Bean, and Juergen Symanzik and 
for the accompanying paper. The following outlines some important information
for running the code and documents the different files included in the 
repository. Note that all of this code was written and checked in RStudio
on Windows machines. It has not been checked with linux, Mac, or other R IDEs.

## Important notes

1. A workflow README is included to guide the user through the data 
cleaning process.

2. All of the files have been checked prior to pushing to the repository. 
All data files and scripts work using relative file paths. The code should 
be able to be run without any changes to the actual code. There are a few
exceptions due to changes in accessing information from Google Maps, but
those are noted on the individual files. 

3. All of the R scripts use relative file paths. That is, if you want to 
run a script you need to set the working directory to the source file and 
the code should run correctly. However, we left a bunch of code that has
been commented out because it may be interesting to the user. This code
was not checked for relative paths and may not run without some tinkering.

4. The majority of the maps used in the graphs came from the fiftystater 
package. Unfortunately, the package was retired from CRAN shortly after the 
Data Expo. Data was also obtained from the retired package weatherData. 
The tarbells for these packages are included in the base directory of 
this repository and can be installed from the base directory using the 
following commands: 
install.packages("fiftystater_1.0.1.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
install.packages("../weatherData_0.5.0.tar.gz", repos = NULL, type = "source")
Note that there is a script that will install all of the packages needed, 
including the two tarbells.

###############################################################################

Contains all of the data for the analyses done for the presentation and the 
paper. It contains datasets and information obtained from outsided sources 
that were used to verify data from the dataset provided for the Data Expo. It 
does not contain the data used for the Shiny App, although data from this 
folder was used to create those datasets. The first section contains the 
data files used in the main analysis. Other data files used to verify 
information or to fill in missing data are described later. 

## Primary data files

# forecast.dat: original forecast dataset provided by the Data Expo. 

# histWeather.csv: original weather dataset provided by the Data Expo. 

# locations.csv: original location dataset provided by the Data Expo. 

# baltWind.csv: contains wind data from Baltimore, MD. 

# censusFigs.R: contains population of the cities in the main dataset. They
were obtained from census.gov.

# cluster_summary.csv: created by cluster_datasets.R. 
Contains the cluster assignments for each city for 5-8 clusters. We 
settled on 6 clusters for this analysis so that is what is seen 
in the paper and presentation. 

# clusterMapFinal.csv: data used to create the cluster maps. It is used
in the finalPCP.R script to 

# Combined_for_Clustering.csv: dataset created to do some 
exploration of the clusters in the pointMicro.R script.

# Combined_for_Clustering_Bean.csv: dataset created to do some 
exploration of the clusters in the pointMicro.R script.

# locationsFinal.csv: created with final_location_clean.R. It contains 
data about each of the cities that are used in the plots and analysis
including the cluster assignment for each city.

# locationsFinal_preclust.csv: created with final_location_clean.R. It 
contains the information needed to create the summary data files. They 
are needed to create the clusters and many of the graphics. 

# final_weather.csv: created with observation_final_clean.R

# final_forecast.csv: created with forecast_final_clean.R. Contains the
cleaned weather forecasts in long form. It is generated from the forecast.dat
file provided by the Data Expo. 

# PrecipErrors.csv: contains different measures for the precipitation
errors. Used in the script pointMicro.R for data exploration.

# summary_city_month_lag.csv: created with the final_data_summaries.R 
script in the data cleaning_folder. It contains the summary statistics
for the recorded weather data for each city aggregated by month and forecast
lag. It also includes the forecast errors by aggregated by month and with 
the lag between the forecast date and the recorded results included in 
the dataset.

# summary_city_month.csv: created with the final_data_summaries.R 
script in the data cleaning_folder. It contains the summary statistics
for the recorded weather data for each city aggregated by month and forecast
lab. It also includes the forecast errors.

# summary_city_lag.csv: created with the final_data_summaries.R 
script in the data cleaning_folder. It contains the summary statistics
for the recorded weather data for each city aggregated by forecast
lag. It also includes the forecast errors.

# summary_city.csv: created with the final_data_summaries.R 
script in the data cleaning_folder. It contains the summary statistics
for the recorded weather data for each city. The data for all lags and 
time frames has been aggregated so there is one observation for each metric
per city. 

# summary_lag_shiny.csv: created with final_lag_all_shiny.R. All of 
the lags. This dataset is used for the shiny app. 

# varNameLabels.csv: contains variable names to create plots. Used in 
final_Random_Forests_VI.R


## Folder: rain_check_files_for_specific_outliers
Contains files that have the precipitation file for several cities with 
suspicious amounts of precipitation reported. 

## Folder: shorlineAK
Contains the files needed to draw and measure from the Alaskan shoreline.

## Folder: shorlineHA
Contains the files needed to draw and measure from the Hawaiian shoreline. 

## us_medium_shoreline
Contains the files needed to draw and measure from the landlocked border
of the U.S. This was needed to compute the distance to the shore.

The following includes information about the R scripts in the rscripts folder. 
Several folders are included in the main folder to 
The first scripts that are listed are in order of work flow. That is, they 
are the scripts that should be run first if you are going to run any of the 
other files. After the initial work flow is listed, the rest of the files 
are listed in order of where they appear in the folder. 

1. packageInstall.R: installs all of the packages needed for the analysis, 
including fiftystater. 


###############################################################################
#								data_cleaning
###############################################################################

# cluster_datasets.R: reads in the city data and adds the cluster information
to create a more complete cluster summary dataset. 

# final_data_summaries.R: reads in the city and final weather data files 
and cleans the data and creates several summary datasets used in downstream 
analysis. 

# forecast_final_clean.R: reads in the original forecast dataset and 
produces a cleaned forecast dataset that better incorporates location data. 

# final_location_clean.R: reads in the location data and adds population 
and cluster information for a more informative location dataset. 

# Notes on Data Issues with Weather Data.pdf: This is a file that describes
many of the most egregious errors seen in the original data. 

# observation_final_clean.R: Reads in the original weather dataset and 
outputs a cleaned dataset in longform. Missing data were replaced with real
data when the information was available from NOAA or other weather sites. 
Obvious data input errors were corrected or replaced with NAs. 

# posterStoriesEDA: contains some code to verify some of the claims made
in our poster.

to adjust the glyphs so they aren't distorted in on the map. 

# glyphTest2.R: contains some preliminary and exploratory code in creating
the glyph map. The code does not work as is because google maps now requires
an api. If you get an api, you can use the code with minor adjustments.
